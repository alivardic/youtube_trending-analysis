## Data and Text Mining Final Project: Maximizing Success on YouTube's Trending Page: Content Optimization Strategies Based on Analysis of the Top 200 Videos Over the Last Four Years

**Topic:** Success Factors on YouTube Trending Videos 

**Question:** What are common trends among the top trending YouTube videos in the US, and how do different factors impact their success on the trending page?

**Goal:** To analyze data from each dayâ€™s top 200 trending YouTube videos from August 2020 to
April 2024 and identify success factors among the most successful videos in the U.S. This
analysis will evaluate a video's success on the trending page based on the following success metrics:

  - *Engagement Ratio:* The total audience interaction (sum of comments, likes, and
  dislikes) relative to the view count as recorded on the final day the video appears on the
  trending list (representing the highest engagement level captured in the dataset)
  
  - *Trending Speed:* How long a video took to reach the trending page
  
  - *Trending Retention:* How long a video remains on the trending page

## Section 3.1: Association Mining Data Prep
The arules algorithm works best with categorical data, therefore, for this section of the project, success metrics had to be classified into categorical values to enable meaningful association mining. This analysis used Tertile-Based Categorization due to the large amount of outliers identified in each success metric in Section 1.5
``` {r, echo = FALSE}
cat(
  "'Good' represents top-performing metrics, 'Mid' represents mixed success, and 'Poor' represents low performance.\n", 
  "\nFor each of the success metrics, the following guidelines are used:\n",
  "- 'days_until_trending': The lower this metric, the better. A shorter time to trend is preferred.\n",
  "- 'trending_retention': The higher this metric, the better. Videos that remain trending for a longer period are more successful.\n",
  "- 'engagement_ratio': The higher this metric, the better. High engagement indicates better viewer interaction.\n",
  "\nTo calculate the overall success of each video relative to the dataset, all success metrics are normalized and then an equally weighted sum is computed. This aggregate score allows for the classification of videos based on their overall performance and can be used to identify associations between various factors and overall success.\n",
  "\n**Note**: It should be noted that while some videos are categorized as having 'Poor' success, all videos in this dataset did reach the YouTube Trending page. Therefore, the 'Poor' success classification is relative to other successful trending videos and does not imply failure to trend."

  "- Poor Success: 12 rules across two channel categories (Sports, News & Politics)\n",

You are 2.34 times more likely to experience Poor Success in this category if you use fewer tags and have short descriptions (78% Confidence).\n",

While we cannot offer a foolproof formula, we can highlight behaviors to avoid in certain content categories to minimize the risk of poor performance. By steering clear of these pitfalls, our clients can reduce their chances of underperforming.\n",
  "Achieving better success most likely depends on more nuanced factors, such as content quality, community engagement, and broader strategies that go beyond simple behaviors like tag usage or posting times. In summary, clients should focus on avoiding these negative patterns, but also recognize that enhancing success requires a balanced and thoughtful content strategy."

## Conclusions 
What are our final recommendations to YouTube Creators based on our the descriptive statistics of our dataset, our sentiment analysis, and our association mining?
``` {r, echo = FALSE}
cat(
  "**Final Conclusions**\n",
  "So what we can recommend to our clients is to keep the majority of videos focused on positivity and then try to add in aspects of anticipation and trust unless stated otherwise. There arenâ€™t really any factors that directly increase the success of a video, but there are some shown to inhibit the success of a video. For instance, comedy channels should keep the number of tags low and titles short while music channels should keep their titles short and have a detailed description, with some sentiments of trust. Additionally, news and politics channels should use lots of tags and have a detailed description, but avoid anticipation sentiments. And lastly, sports channels should use lots of tags, have short tiles, and a detailed description, but avoid trust and anticipation sentiments. In regard to every channel, they should avoid posting during the evenings in Summer to not decrease their chance of making it on the trending page. \n",
  "Overall, there isnâ€™t anything you can really do to guarantee success on YouTube. The best recommendation would be just to make high quality videos that keep people interested and build a following. That way, you will have people ready to watch your videos whenever you post and allow your videos to trend much faster."
